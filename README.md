# SpotifyPlaylistSorter
## This app sorts your Spotify playlists of 100 songs or less by song metadata options that are not regularly available.

### Background

I developed this project to solve a problem that I had noticed regarding the lack of verbose sorting options within Spotify playlists. Specifically, I have very large playlist that span over many decades and I wanted to be able to listen to the playlists in the order that the songs released (starting with oldies to modern or vice-versa).

When looking into the Spotify API I noticed options for Release Date, Danceability, Tempo, and more. I chose to use this project to fulfill one of my last requirements during my CS ungrad program. I hope this project helps to spark some of your own ideas regarding use of the Spotify API. If you're interested in improving the project or even creating a version of your own, please let me know. I would be happy to collaborate and learn more about whatever you're interested in working on.

### Installation
This project is built to run on Google's Cloud Platform. It makes use of App Engine, Flask and Datastore. Copying the repository into Google's Cloud Concole and adding the correct URIs, Client IDs and Secrets should allow the project to run correctly. You will also need to create your own Spotify API Application which is a quick and easy process (and its free).


If you have any questions about the development of the project, or how to use it please reach out to me so that I can clarity.
